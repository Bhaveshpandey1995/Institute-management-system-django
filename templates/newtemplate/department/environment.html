Department of Chemistry &amp; Environmental Science is the new emerging academic department of MMMUT, Gorakhpur. The department was established on June 22, 2019 and inaugurated by Goraksha Pithadish Param Pujya Sri Yogi Adityanath Ji Maharaj, the Honorable Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh under the visionary leadership of renowned academician and technocrat Professor Sri Niwas Singh, Hon’ble Vice Chancellor of Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur. The Department is committed to fostering a respectful workplace culture and strives to cultivate a safe, inclusive and fair environment where staff, faculty, researchers and students can thrive as they advance new chemical frontiers through research, innovation, collaboration and scholarship. <br><br>
As the nascent upcoming department, the pivotal focus is to cater to the academic and research requirements of the budding engineers and basic science researchers. It’s vision is to become a leading university department by conducting quality research in the area of Chemical Science and Environmental Science and offer solutions to the problems organic, inorganic, physical, industrial, analytical chemistry and also solving ecological, environmental problems under the guidance of highly qualified academic team. Apart from imparting quality education to various graduation courses, the department offers Ph. D. in Chemistry as well.<br><br>
The Department of Chemistry &amp; Environmental Science provides a unique focus for addressing some of today’s most pressing environmental and chemical problems. Additional opportunities for joint research are available with our colleagues at the premier Indian Institute of Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, as well as International Institute at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, South Korea. The department's research is supported by grants and contracts from government sources, with principal strengths in the areas of polymeric materials, artificial photosynthesis, molecular modeling and environmental analysis. The proposed vision and mission of the department is as under:<br><br>
Recently, as the constituent part of Applied Science Department, the department organized a <b>National Conference on</b> Recent Advances in Chemical Sciences, <b>March 29-30, 2019 MMMUT, Gorakhpur.</b><br><br>
